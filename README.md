# Question-Answering-System-with-Transformers

Overview:
This project is focused on implementing question-answering using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The primary goal is to demonstrate how pre-trained language models can be used to answer questions based on a given context.

Project Description:
In this project, we leverage the power of Transformers, a state-of-the-art natural language processing architecture, to tackle the question-answering task. Here's a breakdown of what we've done:

Data: We begin by loading the SQuAD dataset, which is a popular dataset for training question-answering models. To ensure efficient training, we split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Preprocessing: A critical part of the project is preparing the data for training. We employ a preprocessing function to tokenize both the questions and contexts. Additionally, we create answer position labels to train our model effectively.

Training: We utilize a pre-trained language model, such as 'distilbert-base-uncased,' and TensorFlow datasets to train our question-answering model. The model is compiled and trained for a specified number of epochs.

Sharing with Hugging Face Hub: To make our model and tokenizer accessible to others, we leverage the Hugging Face Hub. This allows users to easily access and use the model for their own question-answering tasks.
